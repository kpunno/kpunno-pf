This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

Run as container:

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 kpunno-pf
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
